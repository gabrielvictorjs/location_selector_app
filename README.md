## üìù Objective

First of all, this project was built to test the [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/docs/getting_started/) with [Flutter Hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) and how I could use them with a folder structure based on clean architecture concepts.

In addition, it was time to test how to use `--dart-define` to set environment variables and how to call it in native code, specially android.
